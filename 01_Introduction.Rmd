# Why should I invest time in this?


???
As scientists we're constantly generating data.  Although we have some systems in place to assist in archiving data, much of what we produce goes through a process of emailing Excel output.  I hope that over the next few lectures I can show you that this is poor practice and I'll provide you with an alternative which, will free up time and make your analyses more robust.
